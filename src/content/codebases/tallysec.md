## What TallySec Does

TallySec is a **Risk-to-Return Lab Pack** that teaches security teams to communicate findings in executive language. It bridges the gap between technical threat detection and business impact by translating risk scores into ROI metrics.

## The Problem It Solves

Security teams struggle to:
- Communicate technical findings to business stakeholders
- Quantify the business impact of vulnerabilities
- Justify security investments with ROI data
- Train staff on risk prioritization

TallySec provides a complete educational framework that teaches security in the language finance understands.

## Key Capabilities

### AI-Powered Risk Scoring
A deterministic, feature-based scoring engine prioritizes threats and translates technical severity into business impact metrics that executives can act on.

### Complete Lab Environment
Five structured labs take students from basics to advanced concepts. Each includes student materials and instructor answer keys for classroom or self-paced learning.

### Production-Ready API
FastAPI microservice runs locally or containerized. Includes OpenAPI documentation, Postman collection, and example integrations.

### Assessment Suite
Quiz bank covers all modules with an autograder for automated evaluation. Generate certificates for course completion.

### Executive-Ready Outputs
Reports and dashboards present findings in ROI terms—perfect for board presentations and budget justification.

- **Deployment**: Docker and Docker Compose included
- **Dashboard**: Static HTML at web/dashboard.html

## FAQ

**Is this for production security scanning?**
No. TallySec is a training/demo bundle with synthetic data. It teaches concepts, not production threat detection.

Labs progress from beginner to intermediate. Basic Python and API knowledge is helpful but not required.

**Is support included?**
This is a self-serve, no-handover package. Everything needed is included in the repo. Exclusive IP transfer with no ongoing support obligations.
