## The Appeal of Buying vs. Building

Building software from scratch is expensive. Time, talent, and trial-and-error add up fast. That's why buying a pre-built codebase can be incredibly appealing—especially when you need to move quickly.

But not all codebases are created equal. Some are polished products ready for deployment. Others are held together with duct tape and prayers.

## What to Look For

### Documentation Quality

If the README is sparse or nonexistent, that's a red flag. Good documentation signals that the developer cared about maintainability—not just getting it to work once.

**Check for:**
- Setup instructions that actually work
- Architecture overview
- API documentation (if applicable)
- Environment variable documentation

### Test Coverage

Ask for test coverage numbers. Better yet, ask to run the tests yourself. A codebase with 80%+ coverage is generally safer than one with zero tests.

No tests means every change you make is a gamble.

### Dependency Health

Old, unmaintained dependencies are a liability. Check:
- When were dependencies last updated?
- Are there known vulnerabilities? (`npm audit` or similar)
- Are critical dependencies still actively maintained?

### License Clarity

Make sure you're getting full rights to the code. Ask explicitly:
- Can you modify it?
- Can you resell it or build SaaS on top of it?
- Are there any third-party licenses you inherit?

## Red Flags to Watch For

- **No demo environment**: If they can't show it running, why not?
- **"Just needs a few tweaks"**: Usually means "fundamentally broken"
- **Vague pricing**: Good sellers know what their code is worth
- **No support period**: You'll have questions. Make sure someone will answer them.

## Our Approach at Toledo Technologies

When we sell a codebase, we include:
- Full documentation
- A working demo
- 30 days of support for questions
- Clear licensing terms

We want you to succeed with the code, not struggle with it.

## Bottom Line

Buying code can save you months of development time—if you do your homework. Ask the right questions, verify the claims, and never pay for something you haven't seen running.
