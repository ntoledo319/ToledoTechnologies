## The Nonprofit Tech Dilemma

Nonprofits need technology to operate effectively, but they're often stuck with:
- Donated software that doesn't quite fit
- Volunteer developers who disappear
- "Enterprise" solutions priced for Fortune 500s
- DIY solutions held together with hope

There's a better way.

## Principles for Nonprofit Tech

### 1. Ruthless Prioritization

You can't do everything. Pick the one thing that would make the biggest difference and do that well.

**Ask:**
- What's causing the most pain right now?
- What would unlock the most value?
- What can we actually maintain after it's built?

### 2. Boring Technology Wins

The latest JavaScript framework might be exciting, but can your one part-time IT person maintain it?

**Prefer:**
- Well-documented, widely-used tools
- Platforms with strong community support
- Solutions that don't require specialized expertise
- Technology that will exist in 5 years

### 3. Own Your Data

Whatever platform you use, make sure you can:
- Export all your data
- Migrate to another solution if needed
- Access data without paying ransom

Vendor lock-in hits harder when budgets are tight.

### 4. Build for Volunteers

If volunteers will use the system:
- It must be simple (complex = won't get used)
- Training should take minutes, not days
- It should work on phones (not everyone has laptops)

## Where to Spend Limited Budget

### High ROI Areas

- **Donor management**: Good CRM pays for itself
- **Automated communications**: Email that goes out without manual effort
- **Online donations**: Friction kills conversions
- **Reporting**: Know what's working

### Skip For Now

- Custom apps when off-the-shelf works
- AI features that are nice-to-have
- Complete rebuilds when incremental improvements work
- Bleeding-edge technology

## Finding the Right Help

### What to Look For

- Experience with constrained budgets
- Willingness to say "you don't need this"
- Clear communication about tradeoffs
- Realistic timelines
- Maintainable solutions

### Red Flags

- Overselling complex solutions
- No interest in understanding your actual needs
- Can't explain decisions in plain language
- "It'll be done when it's done"

## How We Help Nonprofits

We work with nonprofits because:
- We like solving real problems with constraints
- Shipping value matters more than shipping features
- Every dollar should count

Our approach:
1. Understand what actually matters
2. Propose the simplest solution that works
3. Build it quickly and cleanly
4. Hand it off in a maintainable state
