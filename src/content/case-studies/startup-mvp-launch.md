## The Challenge

A fintech startup had a promising concept and investor interest, but needed a working product to close their seed round. Their timeline: six weeks until the investor deadline.

They had tried working with a dev shop previously, but after two months and significant spend, they had little to show for it.

## Our Approach

### Week 1: Scope and Architecture
We spent the first week understanding exactly what was needed for the investor demo versus nice-to-haves. The result: a focused feature set that demonstrated the core value proposition.

Architecture decisions prioritized:
- Speed of development
- Ability to scale later
- Clean handoff to future internal team

### Weeks 2-4: Core Development
Rapid iteration with daily demos. The founder could see progress every day and provide feedback that was incorporated immediately.

We focused on:
- Core transaction flow
- Essential compliance checks
- Clean, intuitive UI
- Basic admin dashboard

### Week 5: Polish and Edge Cases
With core functionality complete, we addressed edge cases, improved error handling, and polished the user experience. This is where most MVPs fall apart—we didn't skip it.

### Week 6: Deployment and Documentation
Production deployment on AWS with proper monitoring, logging, and alerting. Documentation for the internal team that would eventually take over.

## The Outcome

The MVP launched on schedule. The investor demo went smoothly, and the seed round closed within a month.

More importantly, when the startup hired their first engineer, the handoff was clean. The codebase followed conventions, had test coverage, and included documentation that actually helped.

## Technical Details

- **Stack**: Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL
- **Infrastructure**: AWS (ECS, RDS, CloudFront)
- **Third-party**: Plaid, Stripe
- **Monitoring**: Datadog

## Key Takeaways

- **Scope ruthlessly**: An MVP that ships beats a feature-rich product that doesn't
- **Daily visibility**: Regular demos catch misalignments early
- **Plan for handoff**: The code needs to outlive your involvement
