        <h2>Support</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Support hours:</strong> Monday–Friday, 10:00 AM–5:30 PM (ET)</li>
          <li><strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:hello@toledotechnologies.com">hello@toledotechnologies.com</a></li>
          <li><strong>Typical response time:</strong> within 1 business day (during support hours)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Fulfillment & Delivery</h2>
        
        <h3>Project-based services (custom development)</h3>
        <p>
          Fulfillment is delivered per project scope (statement of work / agreed scope), typically via:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>GitHub repo access or patch/PR delivery</li>
          <li>Documentation/notes for handoff</li>
          <li>Deployment guidance when included in scope</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Timelines are project-dependent and confirmed during scoping.</p>
        
        <h3>Codebase purchases (digital products)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Fulfillment is digital delivery (repo access or download link).</li>
          <li><strong>Delivery timing:</strong> typically within 1 business day after payment is confirmed.</li>
          <li>Each purchase includes a limited support window for setup/questions (typically 30–90 days depending on product listing).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Cancellations (Services)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You can cancel a project at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:hello@toledotechnologies.com">hello@toledotechnologies.com</a>.</li>
          <li>If work has not started, any prepaid amount (if applicable) is refunded minus payment processor fees.</li>
          <li>If work has started, you are billed for work completed up to the cancellation date. Any remaining prepaid balance (if applicable) is refunded minus processor fees.</li>
          <li>For fixed-price projects with milestones: completed milestones are due; in-progress milestone work is billed proportionally.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Refunds</h2>
        
        <h3>Services</h3>
        <p>
          Refunds are handled case-by-case because deliverables are custom and project-based.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we cannot deliver the agreed scope due to our fault, we will either:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Fix the issue, or</li>
          <li>Refund the unused portion of fees paid (minus processor fees), depending on the situation.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Codebase purchases</h3>
        <p>
          Because codebases are digital goods delivered electronically, refunds are limited.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you do not receive delivery within 1 business day after payment confirmation, you may request a full refund.</li>
          <li>If the delivered codebase is materially not as described, contact us within 7 days of delivery. We will either correct the issue or provide a refund if we can't reasonably fix it.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Chargebacks & Disputes</h2>
        <p>
          Please email us first. We respond quickly during support hours and can usually resolve issues without a dispute.
        </p>
